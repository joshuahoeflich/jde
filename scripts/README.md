# Scripts
Convenient shell-scripts. There's nothing here that couldn't also go in `~/bin` or `~/.local/bin`, but packaging these shell files this way lets `nix` keep track of them.

If you need to install these files on a more traditional system, `sudo make install` should do the trick. You can uninstall with `sudo make uninstall` too.
